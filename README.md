Automatic control of lights using microontroller PIC16F877

Automatic street light control is intended to automatically turn on and off street lights. This project measures the light output. Street lights are automatically turned off when there is 80% light availability. But this project will automatically switch on street lights if the amount of light is less than 80%. It may also be modified to suit an individual's needs. Light intensity is measured using a light sensor. The amount of light available is sensed using a light sensor connected to a PIC161F877A microcontroller. The pic16f877a microcontroller produces a control signal after analyzing the amount of light. The transistor, which in turn energizes the relay coil and the relay turns on the street light, is activated by a control signal provided by the pic microcontroller. Only one bulb was utilized in this project. Because this is only being done as an example. You may utilize as many street lights as you desire with this automated control of street lights to put it to practical use.
